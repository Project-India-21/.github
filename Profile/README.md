# Project India 2021

India has ~50000 Health & Wellness Centres (HWC's) up and running.
By 2022, the government plans to transform 150000 Sub Health Centres (SHC), Primary Health Centres (PHC) and Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHC) as HWC’s. We have conceptualized an advanced way to connect HWC’s - for user accessibility, service utilization, full information, and quality control. We are developing an application which will enable a user to locate the nearest Health and Wellness Centres and know verified details.
